Release Notes for Ocean v2.0.0
==============================

This is the first public release, so there is not much to say in here, but in
future release this file will contain important upgrading information.

These notes are usually structured in 3 sections: **Migration Instructions**,
which are the mandatory steps a user must do to update to the new version,
**Deprecated**, which contains deprecated functions which are not recommended to
be used (and will be removed in the next major release) but will not break any
old code, and **New Features** which are new features available in the new
version that users might find interesting.
